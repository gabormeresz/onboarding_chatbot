## What Is a Security Incident?

A security incident is any event that may compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of company systems or data.

Examples include, but are not limited to:

- Suspicious or unusual VPN behavior
- Lost or stolen company devices (laptops, phones, storage media)
- Suspected phishing or social engineering attempts
- Unauthorized access attempts to systems or data
- Malware or ransomware alerts
- Accidental data exposure or data sent to the wrong recipient
- Use of unauthorized software or services

If in doubt, **treat the situation as a security incident** and report it.

## Immediate Actions

If a security incident is suspected or confirmed, take the following steps **immediately**:

1. Disconnect the affected device from the network (Wi-Fi, VPN, Ethernet)
2. Do **not** power off the device unless instructed by IT Security
3. Do **not** attempt to investigate, remediate, or delete anything independently
4. Preserve all evidence (emails, screenshots, error messages)
5. Report the incident immediately to **IT Security**

> ⚠️ Delayed reporting may increase risk and potential damage.
